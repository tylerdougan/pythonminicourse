<h1>Python Style Decomposition</h1>


<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Why are CS106A programs structured the way the are - the many 
functions, the main(), the Doctests. These structures are not an 
accident. There is a reason it's all done a particular way, and here it 
is.

</p><h2>Software Engineering Crisis</h2>

<p>Suppose you need to finish a 500 line coding project, or 1000 lines 
or 10,000 or 100,000 lines. How many hours do you suppose it will take 
to be finished?

</p><p>As computers grew more powerful in the early days of computing, a
 disturbing pattern emerged. Anyone could finish a 500 line project, 
but&nbsp;evidently projects did scale up in size so nicely. A 10x larger
 project took more than 10x longer to complete. Very large projects 
might seemingly never be finished. The project might be abandoned or 
perhaps the users will just have to suffer along with the not-quite-done
 version. I think of this when I'm trying to complete a form online, and
 do something it doesn't like, and the system dumps me back at a blank 
form to re-enter the information. I pause at that moment to appreciate 
that somehow, a lot of software in the world is not really finished.

</p><h2>Software Costs - N<sup>2</sup></h2>

<p>As rough rule of thumb, the difficulty of completing a software project of N lines seems to be proportionate to N<sup>2</sup>

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-n2.svg" alt="alt: n-squared costs per line">

</p><p>The N<sup>2</sup> curve gets extremely steep, piling incredible 
costs on the project as the number of lines goes up. Past some point, 
the project is practically impossible to complete. And yet you live in a
 world with many, enormous and pretty functional projects. how did CS 
escape the N<sup>2</sup> trap?

</p><h2>Divide and Conquer - Functions - Modularity</h2>

<p>CS has this one trick to avoid the N<sup>2</sup> trap. Say we have this 500 line program to write. What are we going to do?

</p><h2>One Big main()</h2>

<p>The naive approach would be to write all the code as one 500 line 
main() function. This is a terrible strategy, getting the worst of the N<sup>2</sup> curve - too much code all in one piece

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-programnew1.svg" alt="alt:one big main()">

</p><h2>Function Decomposition</h2>

<p>The key step is not working on a 500 line project. Work on a series 
of 50 line functions - each nice and cheap - and bundle them together to
 make the 500 line. Or put another way, get left on the N<sup>2</sup> curve.

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-programnew2.svg" alt="alt: program divided into separate functions">

</p><p>This is why functions are such a central part of every 
programming language. Programming is always done at this scale, trying 
to get left on the curve. Striving to keep parts of the program separate
 from each other is also known as the strategy of "modularity".


</p><h2>Functions and Data</h2>

<p>We can divide the program into functions, but how do the functions 
work with each other? With the black-box model, we use the input and 
output data for each function as its contact point with all the other 
functions.

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-blackbox.svg" alt="alt: black box function: parameters in, return value out">


<!--
Once the program is divided into functions, how does data get to the right lines? This leads to the black box model of a function. Each function will have its parameters for data input and its return value for data output.
-->


</p><p>Aside: thought it appears to be a detail, keeping a strict 
structure for data-in and data-out turns out to be important. If 
functions are allowed to access data used by other functions 
arbitrarily, in effect it blends the lines of those functions together. 
It's possible in Python and other languages to use "global variables" to
 move data between functions not just at call/return boundaries. We'll 
never do that in CS106A, concentrating on the proper function-call, 
black-box model that keeps the functions separated from each other.

</p><h2>Whole Program Picture - Data Pipeline</h2>

<p>If the functions are all separate, how do they work with each other? 
The black box model helps here - we connect the output of one function 
to the input of the next. The functions are separate, but work together.

</p><p>You can think of the whole program as a pipeline of functions 
taking in, say, a text file of data to start, each function returning 
some refined version of the data, until we get nice graphs or 
conclusions out at the end, which then get adoring tweets!

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-fndata.svg" alt="alt: pipeline of functions, take in data file to start, putting out conclusions at the end" width="700">

</p><p>The functions are working together, but only through their inputs
 and outputs. This keeps the interaction between them as simple as 
possible.

</p><hr>

<h2>Black Box - Abstraction and Implementation</h2>

<p>You are already familiar with the input/output framing of a function.
 Here we'll add on CS terms "abstraction" and "implementation". These 
ideas are crucial for computer systems, but you may find them handy for 
many parts of life.

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-blackbox-abstr.svg" alt="alt: abstraction vs. implementation">

</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-blackbox-abstr2.svg" alt="alt: abstraction vs. implementation">

</p><h2>Black Box 1 - Abstraction</h2>

<p>The abstraction of a function is what it accomplishes - what it 
requires as input and what it will produce as output. We can think of 
this as the "contract" for the function: what is required to go in. What
 the function promises to provide. The abstraction contract is also 
basically what is written in the triple quoted """Pydoc""" at the top of
 a function.


</p><h2>Black Box 2 - Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation detail of a function is all the code and 
complexity within the function that does the actual work. The word 
"detail" is sometimes used as a blanket term for all the implementation 
features hidden inside a function.

</p><p>Usually, the abstraction for a function is relatively simple compared to its implementation.

</p><h2>Key: Calling A Function - Abstraction</h2>

<p>What do you need to know to call a function correctly? Just the 
abstraction. The implementation can be hidden inside the function. Our 
strategy is to hide "implementation detail" inside the function so the 
rest of the program does not need to know or depend on it. This is howe 
we fight the N<sup>2</sup> curve.


</p><p>
<img src="Style%20Decomposition_files/python-blackbox-abstr3.svg" alt="alt: implementation is hidden">


<!-- njp Isolating detail inside the function is how we are avoiding the N<sup>2</sup> trap, making a series of 10 line things vs. a 100 line thing. -->



</p><h2>Example of Decomposition, Abstraction, Implementation</h2>


<h2>1.  function1()</h2>

<p>Suppose you are writing a big program, and now it's time to work on <code>function1():</code>

</p><pre>def function1(s):
   """Given string s ..."""
   .. lots of detail ..
   .. in here ..
</pre>

<p>Work on function1. At this time, your mind is focussed on the 
function1 abstraction, and you are wrestling with the detail and bugs 
and whatnot of its implementation. Eventually you get it working 
perfectly.

</p><h2>2. function2()</h2>

<p>Now it's time to work on function2() which calls function1() as a helper. Look at the <b>key line</b> below.

</p><pre>def function2(s):
    """..."""
    ....
    part = function1(s)  # the key line
    ...
</pre>

<p>What is your state of mind writing the key line? The <b>abstraction</b> of function1. Do not think about the implementation details of function1, though you were just working on it.

</p><h2>One Implementation in Mind At a Time</h2>

<p>What the N<sup>2</sup> trap tells us, is that keeping all of the 
function implementations in mind at one time is hopeless. Here we only 
think about one implementation at a time. Once a function is done, we 
work only in terms of its abstraction.

</p><h2>The Power Of Not Knowing</h2>

<p>We have sectioned off some of the program complexity inside 
function1. When it's time to call function1() we could think about how 
it is implemented. Instead, we embrace <b>not knowing</b> what's going 
on in there. Just call it, and it should meet its contract. Leverage the
 abstraction to only know what's needed as we go.

</p><p>This is why Python and other languages have the """PyDoc""" 
documentation, allowing the contract to be written out and easily 
accessible on the fly, so programmers can access just the abstraction 
they need, not looking at the implementation details.

</p><h2>Abstraction in CS</h2>

<p>This technique of using the abstraction, isolating complexity within units is <b>the</b>
 central trick by which all large computer systems are built. As an 
example, later in CS106A we will see function calls like the ones below

</p><pre># Get list of filenames inside a directory
filenames = os.listdir('Downloads')

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()
</pre>

<p>We know the abstraction of <code>os.listdir()</code> which is pretty 
simple - a list of string filenames from within a directory (folder). 
But the implementation .. who knows. The code within os.listdir() is 
quite complicated, accessing your operating system, perhaps accessing a 
USB key plugged in to your computer. Calling the function, we do not 
think about that. We assume the function does its job correctly and 
returns a list of valid filename strings, and we just carry on and use 
them. This is the way.

</p><h2>Ride To Airport Abstraction vs. Implementation</h2>

<p>We use abstraction all the time in life - it's the natural way to get multiple people to coordinate on something.

</p><p>Suppose you are getting a ride to the airport. What is the abstraction?

</p><p>Ride to airport abstraction - a pretty short list

</p><ul>
<li>Pick up time and place.
</li><li>Drop off time and place.
</li><li>Ride shared with others y/n.
</li></ul>

<p>Ride to airport implementation details, don't care about:

</p><ul>
<li>Car has alloy wheels
</li><li>Car Car has LED headlights
</li><li>Color of the car seats
</li><li>Is the driver wearing a hat
</li><li>Car has enough fuel
<br>You do care about this in a way, but it's covered by "drop off time/place"
</li></ul>


<p>The point: the abstraction is much simpler than the implementation. 
There is endless detail to the implementation that the abstraction does 
not need to care about. Calling a function is just the abstraction.

</p><h2>Mechanics: Pydoc, Doctests</h2>

<p>So the abstration ideas translate to Python code designing a 
function. Choose a good function name, summarizing what it does. The 
parameters list its inputs. The """Pydoc""" at the top of a function 
summarizes its abstraction in words. What does it require as input? What
 does it promise to return as output? We generally use the word "given" 
in here to refer to the parameters, like "Given values x and y, returns 
something something."

</p><p>You can delete the ":param s: " stuff PyCharm puts in. That 
syntax is seldom used at this time. You can summarize the abstraction 
with the "Given x ..." Pydoc.

</p><p>The Doctests are another way to summarize the abstraction - not 
with words, but with a series of input/output examples. They also have 
the benefit of helping you debug your code.


</p><pre>def del_chars(s, target):
    """
    Given string s and a "target" string,
    return a version of s with all chars that
    appear in target removed, e.g. s 'abc'
    with target 'bx', returns 'ac'.
    (Not case sensitive)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; del_chars('abC', 'acx')
    'b'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; del_chars('ABc', 'aCx')
    'B'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; del_chars('', 'a')
    ''
    """
    result = ''
    target = target.lower()
    for ch in s:
        if ch.lower() not in target:
            result += ch
    return result
</pre>

<h2>Program - Big Picture Checklist</h2>

<ul class="slide">
<li>This is the backstory for every CS106A program
</li><li>Divide the program into functions
</li><li>Work on the helper function first
</li><li>Focus on that function, testing it with Doctests
<br>Test as you go
</li><li>Move on to bigger functions
<br>Call the helper, use its abstraction
</li><li>Build up the whole program
</li><li>Typically main() at the bottom, calling helpers
<br>e.g. look at our crazycat example
</li><li>Do not: write all the code first, THEN start testing
<br>Pre doc-Test CS106A easy for students to do this
<br>A disaster!
</li><li>Doctests are just a small feature
<br>But they enable the right strategy at the big picture level
<br>That's why we love them
</li></ul>
